/**
 * Problem Statement:
Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum.
For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from
some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections.
The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 which has a sum of 6.
